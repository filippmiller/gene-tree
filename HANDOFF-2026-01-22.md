# 2026-01-22 Agent Handoff

## Instructions / Docs reviewed
- `NEXT_AGENT_START_HERE.md` (start guide, Master Plan reminder)
- `docs/MASTER_PLAN.md` (Phase 1 focus, priorities, success metrics, philosophy)
- `CLAUDE.md` (operating rules, output policy, session checklist)
- `docs/ops/runbook.md` (dev/playwright bootstrap commands)
- `NEXT_STEPS.md` and `HANDOFF-2025-11-14.md` (previous backlog, testing expectations)

## Work in this session
- Explored repository structure, skill instructions, and the existing Playwright infrastructure.
- Ran `npm run test:e2e` twice; the suite does not complete because Playwright waits indefinitely for the auth/profile flows and the browser/dev server never stabilize.
- Examined the generated `playwright-report/index.html` and artifacts under `test-results` to confirm repeated timeouts/errors (report, traces, video).
- Identified that Playwright is configured to reuse the dev server and to keep artifacts for failures, but nothing else has changed yet.

## Blocking issues
- Playwright tests hang/time out while waiting for the auth/dashboard flows; no assertions or logic errors were fixed because the test run never finished.
- There is no new code or cleanup yet because investigation stopped at the Playwright timeouts that block any further verification.

## Next steps / Handoff hints
1. Diagnose why the dev server/browser does not finish launching for the Playwright suite (start one spec under `PWDEBUG=1`, check logs, increase `webServer.timeout` if startup is slow).
2. Once the suite can run, rerun the failing spec(s), review `playwright-report/index.html`, and continue with the requested cleanup (per instructions, likely code quality fixes or ESLint warnings).
3. After fixing tests, summarize learnings in `/api/library/ingest` and update `docs/MASTER_PLAN.md` if the plan shifts, as the CLAUDE rules require.
