## Key Strategic Insights

### 1. Story Capture is the Killer Feature
4 of 5 research agents identified weekly story prompts as critical. The Storyworth + Remento model (drip prompts + voice recording) is underserved in the family tree space.

### 2. Elder-Friendly Input is Non-Negotiable
People with stories (70+) don't use apps. Solutions:
- Email reply (they just respond to the email)
- Voice recording (they talk, AI transcribes)
- Magic links (no login required)

### 3. Viral Mechanics Must Be Built-In
Shareable highlight cards and photo magic aren't nice-to-haves - they're the growth engine. MyHeritage's Deep Nostalgia went viral because animated grandparent photos are inherently shareable.

### 4. Engagement Requires Multiple Touchpoints
- Weekly story prompts
- Activity feed with notifications
- Smart nudges for birthdays/anniversaries
- Discovery prompts for incomplete profiles

### 5. AI is the Competitive Differentiator
AI biographies, photo animation, and smart suggestions separate modern apps from legacy players.
