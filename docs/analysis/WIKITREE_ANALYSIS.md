## Summary

WikiTree is a impressive free competitor with a passionate community and 17 years of trust. However, its focus on **historical genealogy with source documentation** is fundamentally different from Gene-Tree's **living family story preservation**.

**Key Takeaway:** Gene-Tree should consider community-building features (forum, challenges, recognition) while maintaining its differentiators:
1. Private individual trees (not shared)
2. Living family focus (not historical)
3. Verification-based trust (not open editing)
4. Story preservation (not source documentation)
5. Modern visual UX (not wiki-style)

WikiTree's community engagement is a model worth studying for Gene-Tree's social features.
