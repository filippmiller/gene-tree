## 10. Ideas for Gene-Tree

### High Priority (Implement)
1. **Guided onboarding wizard** - Copy the 4-step approach
2. **Visual "+" add buttons** - Empty position prompts
3. **Multiple tree views** - Add pedigree and fan charts
4. **Profile sidebar** - Quick access to person details
5. **First-year discount** - 50% off for new users

### Medium Priority (Consider)
6. **Smart Matches concept** - But privacy-first version
7. **Photo colorization** - Partner with AI service
8. **Tree consistency checker** - Data validation tools
9. **Generation selector** - Control tree depth displayed

### Low Priority (Monitor)
10. **DNA integration** - Only with privacy-preserving partner
11. **Historical records** - Partner vs build
12. **Desktop app** - PWA might be sufficient

### Differentiation Opportunities
- **Privacy-first positioning** - MyHeritage weak here
- **Cultural kinship** - Russian terminology not supported
- **Two-way verification** - MyHeritage lacks this
- **Stories focus** - MyHeritage is data-centric

---

## Summary

MyHeritage is a mature, feature-rich platform with strong monetization. Gene-Tree can learn from their onboarding and UX patterns while differentiating on privacy, cultural awareness, and story preservation.

**Key Takeaway:** The onboarding wizard that captures 3 generations in 4 steps is highly effective and should be adapted for Gene-Tree.
