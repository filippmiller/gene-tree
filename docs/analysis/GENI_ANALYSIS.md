## Summary

Geni.com is a solid mid-tier competitor with a generous free offering and strong community. Its position as a MyHeritage subsidiary gives it access to Smart Matches and record databases, but also raises privacy concerns.

**Key Takeaway:** Gene-Tree differentiates from Geni through:
1. **Private individual trees** (not one world tree)
2. **Living family focus** (not historical genealogy)
3. **Verification-based trust** (not open editing)
4. **Granular privacy** (not basic protection)
5. **Story preservation** (not just names/dates)

Geni's GEDCOM import and relationship path features are worth implementing. The free unlimited profiles is a competitive pressure point worth noting.
