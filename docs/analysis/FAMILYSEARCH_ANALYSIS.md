### Compared to Gene-Tree

- **Only you see your living relatives** - Built-in
- **Deceased people public** - Collaborative editing
- **Secure login** - OAuth + native auth

### Key Differentiator
Unlike MyHeritage, FamilySearch has **strong default privacy for living people**. This is closer to Gene-Tree's philosophy but lacks granular control.

### Concerns for Gene-Tree
- **No granular privacy** - All-or-nothing for living people
- **Collaborative model** - Anyone can edit deceased ancestors
- **Church affiliation** - May deter some users

## 10. Ideas for Gene-Tree

### Key Differentiation Opportunities
1. **Living family focus** - FamilySearch is for the dead, Gene-Tree for the living
2. **Granular privacy** - Per-field control vs all-or-nothing
3. **Private trees** - Individual family trees vs shared tree
4. **Verification system** - Two-way confirmation prevents errors
5. **Stories over records** - Memories, not documents

### High Priority (Implement)
1. **Privacy messaging** - Emphasize living people protection like FamilySearch
2. **OAuth options** - Add Google, Apple, Facebook login
3. **Simple onboarding** - FamilySearch's "Begin Your Tree" is clean
4. **AI suggestions** - Like their "AI Research Assistant"

### Medium Priority (Consider)
5. **Memories feature** - Photos, stories, audio like FamilySearch
6. **Following/notifications** - Track changes to relatives
7. **Help center** - Extensive documentation

### Low Priority (Monitor)
8. **Historical records** - Partner vs build
9. **Physical centers** - Not feasible for startup
10. **Free consultations** - Expensive to offer

### What NOT to Copy
- **One world tree** - Gene-Tree's private trees are better for privacy
- **Open editing** - Verification system is superior
- **Church branding** - Secular positioning is broader appeal

## Summary

FamilySearch is a formidable competitor due to being completely free, but its focus is fundamentally different from Gene-Tree. FamilySearch serves **historical genealogy** (connecting to deceased ancestors), while Gene-Tree serves **living family connection** (stories, relationships, privacy).

**Key Takeaway:** Gene-Tree should position against FamilySearch by emphasizing:
1. Living family focus (not just dead ancestors)
2. Private individual trees (not shared)
3. Granular privacy controls (not all-or-nothing)
4. Story preservation (not just names and dates)
5. Verification-based trust (not open editing)

The free competitor makes pricing pressure real, but the use cases are different enough to coexist.
